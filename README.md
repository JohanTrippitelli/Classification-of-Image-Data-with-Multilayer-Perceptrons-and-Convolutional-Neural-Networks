# Classification-of-Image-Data-with-Multilayer-Perceptrons-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
## Project Overview.
This repository features an implementation of a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) designed to address an image classification challenge. The dataset utilized for this project consists of images depicting various clothing items, each associated with a specific class denoting its nomenclature.

The employed MLP architecture boasts undetermined hidden layers (depth) and perceptrons (width). This strategic flexibility enables the project team to explore and identify the optimal model configuration for accurate clothing classification. The meticulous evaluation of varying hidden layer depths and perceptron widths contributes to the project's commitment to achieving superior classification performance.

## Data
Two datasets were utilized to test the performance of the MLP.
- The first was the FashionMNIST dataset found on Kaggle.
- The second was the CIFAR10 dataset downloaded directly from torchvision

## Libraries
- Torch for data collection
- Numpy for numerical manipulation
- Matplot for data visualization
- sklearn for data split

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to identify the optimal combination of parameters and hyperparameters for addressing the clothing classification problem. Specifically, the investigation involved rigorous testing to ascertain the most effective size for MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) depth and width, as well as the optimal activation function for the MLP's hidden layers. Additionally, the project included a comprehensive exploration of standard hyperparameters, such as learning rate and weight initialization. This thorough examination aimed to establish a robust foundation for achieving superior performance in clothing classification through systematic parameter tuning.
